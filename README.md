React Native starter 

**Getting started with a new React Native project**

NodeJS 4.0 or greater is required for React Native. The default Homebrew package for Node is currently 6.0.
Use Homebrew to install Node.js
brew install node

The React Native command line tools allow you to easily create and initialize projects, etc.
npm install -g react-native-cli

Xcode 7.0 or higher. Open the App Store or go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/. This will also install git as well.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is recommended you install it for better performance.
brew install watchman

To create a new React Native project
react-native init NewNativeProject
cd NewNativeProject
You can then either run react-native run-ios from the command line OR 
open the .xcodeproj file from the project and hit play, then run npm start in the project root.

Build your App.
